## TD1

This project implements a solution to a [percolation problem](https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/PercolationOnASquareGrid/) using the union find data structure in Java. Multiple possible solutions are implemented with an increasing gain in complexity, this is done following the workflow described in the problem statement which is provided in the root. The code has been commented to facilitate reading.
